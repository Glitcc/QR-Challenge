## My process

I first created an HTML file making sure to create a .card class for customizing CSS and I worked on CSS to edit the allignments of all the elements and images to make the page look as close to the preview image as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

From this point onwards I intend to polish my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills and build more projects refine my skills.
